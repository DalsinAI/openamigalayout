# OpenLayout

OpenLayout is the small semantic layout and display-list engine shared by the Open Amiga applications.

It is intentionally independent of OpenWrite document formats and HTML parsing. Consumers provide a semantic tree and computed styles; OpenLayout provides deterministic geometry, stable object IDs, hit-testing and a renderer-neutral display list.

## First light

The 0.1 foundation includes:

- exact units shared by CSS pixels, print points and OpenWrite twips;
- stable semantic IDs;
- block/inline flow and word wrapping;
- text measurement callback;
- image nodes;
- background rectangles;
- display list;
- semantic bounds;
- role/name lookup;
- hit testing;
- headless host tests;
- AmigaOS 3.x 68040 + FPU cross-build: it needs a 68040 with an FPU (a full 68040, not an LC or EC040). The browser stack stays hard float for now.

## Documents (0.2)

0.2 adds what a word processor, a presentation program and desktop
publishing need, on the same tree and display list:

- pages: the galley cut between lines, never inside a line, a picture, a
  table row, a frame or a kept-together block, with page breaks before
  and keep-with-next; each display op carries its page;
- grid tables: column widths, column spans, every cell as tall as its row,
  borders;
- frames placed out of the flow (text boxes, pictures, slides' shapes);
  in 0.4 a frame can be anchored to its page (`box.anchor`): placed from
  the page's edge, its margins or its paragraph on the page the paragraph
  starts on, behind the text or in front of it, without moving the page's
  breaks (a cover's whole-page picture and its title boxes);
- alignment (start, centre, end, justified) and one baseline a line, so
  mixed sizes and pictures line up;
- tab stops: a block's own, then every half inch; a first line that
  hangs stops at the left edge, so a list's text lines up;
- a font number for each run, passed to the measure callback and the
  renderer;
- the caret and the character under a point, for editing;
- drawing at the display's resolution: an `ol_scale` (dots per inch and
  zoom, or a page fitted to a window) turns units into pixels with one
  multiply and shift, edges rounded so touching boxes touch, and
  `ol_draw_page` hands a renderer only the ops that cross the area it is
  drawing, already in pixels. Text is measured for layout at full
  resolution and drawn with a font at the scaled size, so nothing is
  drawn into a big bitmap and scaled down.

`tests/test_document.c` covers each of them.

## Tab stops that align (0.3)

`ol_node_set_tab_stops` gives a block's stops with their alignment and
leader: a right stop ends the text after its tab at the stop, a centred
one centres it there, a decimal one puts its first `.` there. A stop may
be past the line's end, as a contents page's page numbers often are. The
leader (dots, hyphens, underscores, middle dots or a heavy rule) is in the
tab's text op, `OL_TEXT_LEADER_OF(op->u.text.style.text_flags)`, for the
renderer to draw across the op's bounds. `ol_node_set_tabs` still sets
left stops without leaders.

## Build and test

Host:

```sh
make test
```

Amiga static target:

```sh
./build-amiga.sh
```

A program that lays a document out again after each change (an editor: a new `ol_document` each time) can
give `ol_document_reserve` the last layout's `ol_display_count` and a little more (0.5): the display list then
takes one block of about that size before the nodes' small ones, and doesn't grow by doubling. Pages are
sorted where the list is, not copied into a second one. On an Amiga, libnix's malloc kept the doubled and
copied blocks of a 30-page document (3 MB) in its pools after every relayout.

Text goes round a frame anchored to its page when the frame's `ol_box_style` has a `wrap` (0.6):
`OL_WRAP_SQUARE` puts the body's lines beside it, on either side with room (at least `OL_WRAP_MIN`),
`OL_WRAP_TOP_BOTTOM` above and below it, both `wrap_gap` from its edges. A frame's zone is worked out where
its paragraph starts, on the page that paragraph's first line is on (from the pages cut so far), so the
lines after it wrap round it in the same pass; a frame placed above its paragraph, or one that moves the
page it is on, takes another pass (at most `OL_WRAP_PASSES` in all). A document with nothing to wrap round
is laid out once, as before. Lines in table cells and in frames do not wrap. `ol_frame_place` says where an
anchored frame went (its page and rectangle), for an editor to find the text box under the pointer.

Resident Amiga library and ABI test:

```sh
./build-library.sh
```

The resident build produces `build-amiga/lib/openlayout.library` plus the public `libraries/`, `proto/` and `inline/` headers. It uses a process-free Exec allocation runtime so documents owned by the resident library do not depend on a caller's libc startup. The current ABI is `openlayout.library` 7.0. Version 2 added the node inspection vectors required by shared renderers and automation; version 3 adds the document calls (pages, tables, frames, tab stops, the caret, the display scale and `OL_DrawPage`) after them, so programs built for version 2 keep working; version 4 adds `OL_NodeSetTabStops` after those; version 5 places frames anchored to their pages (`box.anchor`, OpenLayout 0.4) with no new calls; version 6 adds `OL_DocumentReserve` (OpenLayout 0.5); version 7 wraps text round anchored frames (`box.wrap`, OpenLayout 0.6) and adds `OL_FramePlace` (where a frame went). A program that uses the document calls opens `OPENLAYOUTLIB_DOCUMENT_VERSION` (3), one that sets aligned tab stops `OPENLAYOUTLIB_TABSTOP_VERSION` (4), one that anchors frames `OPENLAYOUTLIB_ANCHOR_VERSION` (5), one that reserves the display list's room `OPENLAYOUTLIB_RESERVE_VERSION` (6), and one that wraps text round frames `OPENLAYOUTLIB_WRAP_VERSION` (7). The library's `OL_BoxStyleInit` fills only the `ol_box_style` that programs built for 3 and 4 have (`OL_BOX_STYLE_SIZE_0_3` bytes), so it never writes past theirs; a program that anchors a frame then sets `size` to `sizeof(ol_box_style)` and `anchor` (and `wrap` and `wrap_gap`).

The OS 3.2.3 / AC090 68040 qualification opens the library from `LIBS:` and runs both the normal ABI test and a 48-node stress test covering allocation growth, metadata, image nodes, layout and display-list access.

The Amiga builds use the AmigaChrome os32-gcc16 stove by default.

## Geometry

- 1 point = 80 OpenLayout units
- 1 CSS pixel = 60 units
- 1 twip = 4 units
- 1 inch = 5760 units
